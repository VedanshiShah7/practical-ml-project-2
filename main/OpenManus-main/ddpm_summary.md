# Summary of Probabilistic Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs)

DDPMs are a class of generative models that learn to generate data by gradually reversing a process that adds noise to the data until it becomes pure noise.

## Core Idea

The core idea behind DDPMs is to define a forward diffusion process (noising) and a reverse diffusion process (denoising).

## Forward Diffusion Process (Noising)

The forward diffusion process is a Markov chain that gradually adds Gaussian noise to the data, transforming it into a completely random noise distribution. This process can be seen as gradually destroying the structure in the data.

## Reverse Diffusion Process (Denoising)

The reverse diffusion process learns to reverse the forward process, starting from random noise and gradually denoising it to generate a sample resembling the original data distribution. This is typically done using a neural network trained to predict the noise added at each step.

## Key Concepts

*   **Probabilistic:** The diffusion process is defined probabilistically, allowing for a mathematically sound framework for training and generation.
*   **Denoising:** The model learns to remove noise, which is crucial for reversing the diffusion process and generating high-quality samples.
*   **Connection to Langevin Dynamics:** DDPMs are related to Langevin dynamics, a method for sampling from a probability distribution.
*   **Score Matching:** The training of DDPMs involves score matching, a technique for estimating the gradient of the data distribution.

## Applications

*   **Image Generation:** DDPMs have shown impressive results in image generation, producing high-quality and diverse samples.
*   **Image Compression:** The paper explores the potential of DDPMs for image compression.
